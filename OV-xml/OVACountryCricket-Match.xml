                <!--scw 7/27/22: EDITORIAL QUESTION: In this sketch, MRM describes the village or parish's cricket match with opposing regions' teams. I've marked those regions with the _OV extension to distinguish them from real places, but kept Shinfield as the hometown team, without distinguishing it as a fictional/OV place. I wonder if all OV places like the village and the internal parish should be given their own xml:id's -->
                <!--scw 7/29/22: In a letter to Elford, August 31, 1816, MRM mentions a cricket match between "Shenfield" and Swallowfield in which the home team won. Letter in our files but not begun. xml:id MRM1689. See Lestrange I, 256. She writes of loving cricket in Aug 20, 1815.-->
                <p> <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I</persName> doubt if there be any scene in the world more animating or delightful than a cricket-match :—I do not mean a set match at <orgName ref="#Lords_Cricket_Ground">Lord's Ground</orgName> for money, hard money, between a certain number of <orgName ref="#CountryCM_gent_cricketers_OV">gentleman and players</orgName>, as they are called—people who make a trade of that noble sport, and degrade it into an affair of bettings, and hedgings, and cheatings, it may be, like boxing or horse-racing: nor do I mean a pretty <foreign xml:lang="fr">fête</foreign> in a gentleman’s park, where <orgName ref="#CountryCM_cricket_dandies_OV">one club
                    of cricketing dandies</orgName> encounters another such club, and where they show off in
                    graceful costume to a gay marquee of <orgName ref="#CountryCM_belles_OV">admiring belles</orgName>, who condescend so to
                    purchase admiration, and while away a long summer morning in partaking cold
                    collations, conversing occasionally, and seeming to understand the game;—the
                    whole being conducted according to ball-room etiquette, so as to be exceedingly
                    elegant and exceedingly dull. No! the cricket that I mean is a real solid
                    old-fashioned match between neighbouring parishes, where each attacks the other
                    for ho-<pb n="147"/>nour and a supper, glory, and half a crown a man. If there be
                    any gentlemen amongst them, it is well—if not, it is so much the better. Your
                    gentleman is in general rather an anomalous character. Elderly
                    gentlemen are obviously good for nothing; and young beaux are, for the most
                    part, hampered and trammelled by dress and habit; the stiff cravat, the
                    pinched-in waist, the dandy walk—oh they will never do for cricket! Now, our
                    country lads, accustomed to the flail or the hammer (your blacksmiths are
                    capital hitters,) have the free use of their arms; they know how to move their
                    shoulders; and they can move their feet too—they can run; then they are so much
                    better made, so much more athletic, and yet so much lissomer—to use a <placeName ref="#Hampshire_county">Hampshire</placeName>
                    phrase, which deserves at least to be good English. Here and there, indeed, one
                    meets with an old Etonian, who retains his boyish love for that game which
                    formed so considerable a branch of his education; some even preserve their
                    boyish proficiency, but in general it wears away like the Greek, quite as
                    certainly, and almost as fast; a few years of <orgName ref="#Oxford_Univ">Oxford</orgName>, or <orgName ref="#Cambridge_Univ">Cambridge</orgName>, or the
                    continent, are sufficient to annihilate both the power and the inclination. No!
                    a village match is the thing,—where our highest officer—our conductor (to borrow
                    a musical term) is but a little farmer’s second son; where a day-labourer is our
                    bowler, and a blacksmith our long-stop; where the<pb n="148"/> <orgName ref="#CountryCM_cricketSpectators_OV">spectators</orgName>
                    consist of the retired cricketers, the veterans of the green, the careful
                    mothers, the girls, and all the boys of two parishes, together with a few
                    amateurs little above them in rank, and not at all in pretension; where laughing
                    and shouting, and the very ecstasy of merriment and good humour, prevail: such a
                    match, in short, as I attended yesterday, at the expense of getting twice wet
                    through, and as I would attend tomorrow, at the certainty of having that ducking
                    doubled.</p>
                <p>For the last three weeks <rs type="place" ref="#ThreeMileCross">our village</rs> has been in a state of great excitement,
                    occasioned by a challenge from our north-western neighbours, the <orgName ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">men of B</orgName>, to
                    contend with us at cricket. Now we have not been much in the habit of playing
                    matches. Three or four years ago, indeed, we encountered the <orgName ref="#CountryCM_S_cricketers_OV">men of <placeName ref="#S_parish_OV">S</placeName></orgName><!-- scw: unsure what this town is or whether it's parish-->, our
                    neighbours south-by-east, with a sort of doubtful success, beating them on our
                    own ground, whilst they in the second match returned the compliment on theirs.
                    This discouraged us. Then an unnatural coalition between a <persName ref="#CountryCM_highChurch_curate_OV">high-church curate</persName>
                    and an <persName ref="#CountryCM_evangelical_farmer_OV">evangelical gentleman-farmer</persName> drove <orgName ref="#CountryCM_cricketers_OV">our lads</orgName> from the Sunday evening
                    practice, which, as it did not begin before both services were concluded, and as
                    it tended to keep the young men from the ale-house, our <orgName ref="#CountryCM_magistrates_OV">magistrates</orgName> had winked
                    at, if not encouraged. The sport therefore had languished until the present
                    season, when under another change of circumstances the spirit began to
                    revive.<pb n="149"/> Half a dozen fine active <orgName ref="#CountryCM_lads_of_influence_OV">lads, of influence</orgName> amongst
                    their comrades, grew into men and yearned for cricket: an <persName ref="#CountryCM_publican_OV">enterprising publican</persName>
                    gave a set of ribands; his rival, <rs type="person" ref="#RoseInnLandlord_OV">mine host of the Rose</rs>, an out-doer by
                        profession, gave two; and the <rs type="person" ref="#CountryCM_highChurch_curate_OV">clergyman</rs> and his <rs type="person" ref="#CountryCM_evangelical_farmer_OV">lay ally</rs>, both well-disposed and
                    good-natured men, gratified by the submission to their authority, and finding,
                    perhaps, that no great good resulted from the substitution of public houses
                    for-out-of door diversions, relaxed. In short the practice recommenced, and the
                    hill was again alive with men and boys, and innocent merriment; but farther than
                    the riband matches amongst ourselves nobody dreamed of going, till this
                    challenge—we were modest, and doubted our own strength. The <orgName ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">B people</orgName>, on the
                    other hand, must have been braggers born a whole parish of gasconaders<note resp="#scw">ie. braggarts</note>. Never
                    was such boasting! such crowing! such ostentatious display of practice! such
                    mutual compliments from man to man—bowler to batter, batter to bowler! It was a
                    wonder they did not challenge all <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName>. It must be confessed that we were a
                    little astounded; yet we firmly resolved not to decline the combat; and one of
                    the most spirited of the new growth, <persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William Grey</persName> by name, took up the glove in
                    a style of manly courtesy, that would have done honour to a knight in the days
                    of chivalry.—<said who="#Grey_William_OV" direct="false" aloud="true">“We were not professed players,”</said> he said, <said who="#Grey_William_OV" direct="false" aloud="true">being little better than
                    school-boys, and scarcely<pb n="150"/> older: but, since they had done us the
                    honour to challenge us, we would try our strength. It would be no discredit to
                    be beaten by such <rs type="org" ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">a field</rs>.”</said></p>
                <p>Having accepted the wager of battle, <rs type="person" ref="#Grey_William_OV">our champion</rs> began forthwith to collect his
                    <rs type="org" ref="#CountryCM_cricketers_OV">forces</rs>. <persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William Grey</persName> is himself one of the finest youths that one shall
                    see,—tall, active, slender and yet strong, with a piercing eye full of sagacity,
                    and a smile full of good humour,—a farmer’s son by station, and used to hard
                    work as farmers’ sons are now, liked by every body, and admitted to be an
                    excellent cricketer. He immediately set forth to muster his men, remembering
                    with great complacency that <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel Long</persName>, a bowler <emph><foreign xml:lang="fr">comme il y en a

                    bowled us out at the fatal return match some years ago at <placeName ref="#S_parish_OV">S</placeName>., had luckily, in a

                    parish, and actually belonged to us. Here was a stroke of good fortune! <rs type="person" ref="#Grey_William_OV">Our
                        captain</rs> applied to him instantly; and he agreed at a word. Indeed <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel Long</persName> is
                    a very civilised person. He is a middle-aged man who looks rather old amongst
                    our young lads, and whose thickness and breadth give no token of remarkable
                    activity; but he is very active, and so steady a player! so safe! We had half
                    gained the match when we had secured him. He is a man of substance, too, in
                    every way; owns one <rs type="animal" ref="#cow">cow</rs>, two <rs type="animal" ref="#donkey">don-<pb n="151"/>keys</rs>, six <rs type="animal" ref="#pig">pigs</rs>, and <rs type="animal" ref="#goose">geese</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="#duck">ducks</rs>
                    beyond count; dresses like a farmer, and owes no man a shilling;— and all this
                    from pure industry, sheer day-labour. Note, that your good cricketer is commonly
                    the most industrious man in the parish; the habits that make him such are
                    precisely those which make a good workman—steadiness, sobriety, and
                    activity—<persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel Long</persName> might pass for the beau ideal of the two characters. Happy
                    were we to possess him! Then we had another piece of good luck. <persName ref="#Brown_James_OV">James Brown</persName>, a
                    journeyman blacksmith and a native, who, being of a rambling disposition, had
                    roamed from place to place for half a dozen years, had just returned to settle
                    with <persName ref="#Brown_J_bro_OV">his brother</persName> at another corner of our village, bringing with him a
                    prodigious reputation in cricket and in gallantry—the gay Lothario of the
                    neighborhood. He is said to have made more conquests in love and in cricket than
                    any blacksmith in the county. To him also went the indefatigable <persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William Grey</persName>,
                    and he also consented to play. No end to our good fortune! Another celebrated
                    batter, called <persName ref="#Hearne_Joseph_OV">Joseph Hearne</persName>, had likewise recently married into the parish. He
                    worked, it is true, at the <placeName ref="#A_mills_OV">A. mills</placeName>, but slept at the house of <rs type="person" ref="#Hearne_Jos_fatherInLaw_OV">his wife’s father</rs>
                    in <rs type="place" ref="#Shinfield">our territories</rs>. He also was sought and found by <rs type="person" ref="#Grey_William_OV">our leader</rs>. But he was grand
                    and shy; made an immense favour of the thing; courted courting and then hung
                    back;—<said who="#Hearne_Joseph_OV" direct="false" aloud="true">“Did not know that he could be spared; had partly resolved<pb n="152"/>
                    not to play again—at least not this season; thought it rash to accept the
                    challenge; thought they might do without him—”</said>—<said who="#Grey_William_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“Truly I think so too,”</said> said our

                <p> Having thus secured two powerful auxiliaries, and rejected a third, we began to
                    reckon and select the <rs type="org" ref="#CountryCM_cricketers_OV">regular native forces</rs>. Thus ran our list:—<persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William Grey</persName>,

                <p>We had now ten of our eleven, but the
                    choice of the last occasioned some demur. Three young <orgName ref="#MartinBoys_OV">Martins</orgName> ,
                    rich farmers of the neighbourhood, successively presented themselves, and were
                    all rejected by <rs type="person" ref="#Grey_William_OV">our inde-<pb n="153"

                        direct="true" aloud="true">“Not good enough,”</said> was his pithy answer.
                    Then our worthy neighbour, the half-pay <persName ref="#Lieutenant_OV"
                        >lieutenant</persName>, offered his services—he, too, though with some
                    hesitation and modesty, was refused—<said who="#Grey_William_OV" direct="true"
                        aloud="true">”Not quite young enough”</said> was his sentence. <persName
                        ref="#Strong_John_OV">John Strong</persName>, the exceedingly long son of
                    our dwarfish <persName ref="#Mason_OV">mason</persName>, was the next

                    middle—a thread-paper, six feet high! We were all afraid that, in spite of his
                    name, his strength would never hold out. <said who="#Grey_William_OV"
                        direct="true" aloud="true">“Wait till next year, <persName

                    and the eleventh man remained unchosen, almost till the eleventh hour. The eve
                    of the match arrived, and the post was still vacant, when a little boy of
                    fifteen, <persName ref="#Willis_David_OV">David Willis</persName>, brother to
                        <persName ref="#Willis_Robert_OV">Robert</persName>, admitted by accident to
                    the last practice, saw eight of them out, and was voted in by acclamation.</p>
                <p>That Sunday evening’s practice (for Monday was the important day) was a period of
                    great anxiety, and, to say the truth, of great pleasure. There is something
                    strangely delightful in the innocent spirit of party. To be one of a numerous
                    body, to be authorised to say <emph rend="italic">we</emph>, to have a rightful interest in
                    triumph or defeat, is gra-<pb n="154"/>tifying at once to social feeling and to
                    personal pride. There was not a ten-year old urchin, or a septuagenary woman in
                    the parish, who did not feel an additional importance, a reflected consequence,
                    in speaking of <quote>“our side.”</quote> An election interests in the same way; but that
                    feeling is less pure. Money is there, and hatred, and politics, and lies. Oh, to
                    be a voter, or a voter’s wife, comes nothing near the genuine and hearty
                    sympathy of belonging to a parish, breathing the same air, looking on the same
                    trees, listening to the same <rs type="animal" ref="#nightingale">nightingales</rs>! Talk of a patriotic elector!— Give me
                    a parochial patriot, a man who loves his parish! Even we, the female partisans,
                    may partake the common ardour. I am sure I did. I never, though tolerably eager
                    and enthusiastic at all times, remember being in a more delicious state of
                    excitation than on the eve of that battle. Our hopes waxed stronger and
                    stronger. Those of <orgName ref="#CountryCM_cricketers_OV">our players</orgName>, who were present, were excellent. <persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William Grey</persName>
                    got forty notches off his own bat; and that brilliant hitter <persName ref="#Coper_Tom_OV">Tom Coper</persName> gained
                    eight from two successive balls. As the evening advanced, too, we had
                    encouragement of another sort. <rs type="person" ref="#Grover_Charles_OV">A spy</rs>, who had been despatched to reconnoitre <rs type="org" ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">the
                        enemy</rs>’s quarters, returned from their practising ground, with a most consolatory
                    report. <said who="#Grover_Charles_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“Really,”</said> said Charles Grover, <rs type="person" ref="#Grover_Charles_OV">our intelligencer</rs>—a fine old steady
                    judge, one who had played well in his day—<said who="#Grover_Charles_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“they are no better<pb n="155"/> than
                    so many old women. Any five of ours would beat their eleven.”</said> This sent us to
                    bed in high spirits.</p>
                <p>Morning dawned less favourably. The sky promised a series of deluging showers,
                    and kept its word, as English skies are wont to do on such occasions; and a
                    lamentable message arrived at the head-quarters from our trusty comrade <persName ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">Joel Brent</persName>. <rs type="person" ref="#Brent_J_master_OV">His master</rs><!--scw: find out who Joel Brent worked for-->, a great farmer, had begun the hay-harvest that very morning,
                    and <persName ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">Joel Brent</persName>, being as eminent in one field as in another, could not be spared.
                    Imagine <persName ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">Joel Brent</persName>’s plight! the most ardent of all our eleven! a knight held back
                    from the tourney! a soldier from the battle! The <rs type="person" ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">poor swain</rs> was inconsolable. At
                    last, one who is always ready to do a good-natured action, great or little, set
                    forth to back his petition; and, by dint of appealing to the public spirit of
                    <rs type="person" ref="#Brent_J_master_OV">our worthy neighbour</rs>, and the state of the barometer, talking alternately of the
                    parish honour and thunder showers, of lost matches and sopped hay, he carried
                    his point, and returned triumphantly with the delighted <persName ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">Joel Brent</persName>.</p>
                <p>In the meantime we became sensible of another defalcation. On calling over our
                    roll, <persName ref="#Brown_James_OV">Brown</persName> was missing; and the spy
                    of the preceding night, <persName ref="#Grover_Charles_OV">Charles

                    practising place of <rs type="org" ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">our opponents</rs>, and <emph rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="la">terra incognita</foreign></emph> to us. We
                    found our adversaries on the ground as we expected, for our various delays had
                    hindered us from taking the field so early as we wished; and, as soon as we had
                    settled all preliminaries, the match began.</p>
                <p>But, alas! I have been so long settling my preliminaries that I have left myself
                    no room for the detail<pb n="160"/> of our victory, and must squeeze the account
                    of our grand achievements into as little compass as <persName ref="#Cowley_Abe">Cowley</persName>, when he crammed the
                    names of eleven of his mistresses into the narrow space of four eight-syllable
                    lines.<note resp="#scw">Mitford is referring to <persName ref="#Cowley_Abe">Cowley</persName>'s poem <title level="a" ref="#The_Chronicle">The Chronicle</title>.</note> <emph rend="italic">They</emph> began the warfare—these boastful <orgName ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">men of B.</orgName> And what
                    think you, gentle reader, was the amount of their innings? These challengers—the
                    famous eleven—how many did they get? Think! imagine! guess!—You
                    cannot?—Well!—they got twenty-two, or rather they got twenty; for two of theirs
                    were short notches, and would never have been allowed, only that, <!--scw: I should annotate the rules of cricket-->seeing what
                    they were made of, we and <persName ref="#CountryCM_umpire_OV">our umpire</persName> were not particular.—They should have had
                    twenty more, if they had chosen to claim them. Oh, how well we fielded! and how
                    well we bowled! our good play had quite as much to do with their miserable
                    failure as their bad. <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel Long</persName> is a slow bowler, <persName ref="#Simmons_George_OV">George Simmons</persName> a fast one,
                    and the change from <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Long</persName>’s lobbing to <persName ref="#Simmons_George_OV">Simmons</persName>’s fast balls posed them
                    completely. Poor simpletons! they were always wrong, expecting the slow for the
                    quick, and the quick for the slow. Well, we went in. And what were our innings?
                    Guess again!—guess! A hundred and sixty-nine! in spite of soaking showers, and
                    wretched ground, where the ball would not run a yard, we headed them by a
                    hundred and forty-seven; and then they gave in, as well they might. <persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William<pb
                        n="161"/> Grey</persName> pressed them much to try another innings. <said who="#Grey_William_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“There was so much
                    chance,”</said> as he courteously observed, <said who="#Grey_William_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“in cricket, that advantageous as our
                        position seemed, we might, very possibly, be overtaken. The <orgName ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">B. men</orgName> had better
                    try.”</said> But they were beaten sulky, and would not move—to my great disappointment;
                    I wanted to prolong the pleasure of success. What a glorious sensation it is to
                    be for five hours together winning—winning—winning! always feeling what a
                    whist-player feels when he takes up four honours, seven trumps! Who would think
                    that a little bit of leather, and two pieces of wood, had such a delightful and
                    delighting power? </p>
                <p>The only drawback on my enjoyment, was the failure of the pretty boy, <persName ref="#Willis_David_OV">David Willis</persName>, who injudiciously put in first, and playing for the first time in a
                    match amongst men and strangers, who talked to him, and stared at him, was
                    seized with such a fit of shamefaced shyness, that he could scarcely hold his
                    bat, and was bowled out, without a stroke, from actual nervousness. <said who="#Coper_Tom_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“He will
                    come of that,”</said> <persName ref="#Coper_Tom_OV">Tom Coper</persName> says.—I am afraid he will. I wonder whether <persName ref="#Coper_Tom_OV">Tom</persName> had
                    ever any modesty to lose. Our other modest lad, <persName ref="#Strong_John_OV">John Strong</persName>, did very well; his
                    length told in fielding, and he got good fame. <persName ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">Joel Brent</persName>, the rescued mower,
                    got into a scrape, and out of it again; his fortune for the day. He ran out his
                    mate, <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel Long</persName>; who, I <pb n="162"/>do believe, but for the excess of <persName ref="#Brent_Joel_OV">Joel Brent</persName>’s
                    eagerness, would have staid in till this time, by which exploit he got into sad
                    disgrace; and then he himself got thirty-seven runs, which redeemed his
                    reputation. <persName ref="#Grey_William_OV">William Grey</persName> made a hit which actually lost the cricket-ball. We
                    think she lodged in a hedge, a <measure quantity=".25" unit="mi">quarter of a mile</measure> off, but nobody could find her.
                    And <persName ref="#Simmons_George_OV">George Simmons</persName> had nearly lost his shoe, which he tossed away in a passion,
                    for having been caught out, owing to the ball glancing against it. These,
                    together with a very complete somerset of <persName ref="#Appleton_Ben_OV">Ben Appleton</persName>, our long-stop, who
                    floundered about in the mud, making faces and attitudes as laughable as
                    <persName ref="#Grimaldi_Jos">Grimaldi</persName>, none could tell whether by accident or design, were the chief
                    incidents of the scene of action. Amongst the spectators nothing remarkable
                    occurred, beyond the general calamity of two or three drenchings, except that a
                    form, placed by the side of a hedge, under a very insufficient shelter, was
                    knocked into the ditch, in a sudden rush of <orgName ref="#CountryCM_cricketers_OV #CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">the cricketers</orgName> to escape a pelting
                    shower, by which means all parties shared the fate of <persName ref="#Appleton_Ben_OV">Ben Appleton</persName>, some on land
                    and some by water; and that, amidst the scramble, a saucy gipsy of a <rs type="person" ref="#CountryCM_thief_OV">girl</rs>
                    contrived to steal, from the knee of the demure and well-apparelled <persName ref="#Long_Samuel_OV">Samuel Long</persName>,
                    a smart handkerchief, which his careful <rs type="person" ref="#Long_SamMother_OV">dame</rs> had tied around it, to preserve his

                    thus reversing the story of <persName ref="#Desdemona_O">Desdemona</persName>, and causing the new <persName ref="#Othello_O">Othello</persName> to call aloud
                    for his handkerchief, to the great diversion of the company. And so we parted;

                    good-humoured, and all happy—except the <rs type="org" ref="#CountryCM_B_cricketers_OV">losers</rs>.</p>
                <p>To-day we are happy too. Hats, with ribands in them, go glancing up and down; and
