                <p>The prettiest cottage on our village-green is the little dwelling of <persName ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">Dame Wilson</persName>. It stands in a corner of the common, where the hedgerows go curving off into a sort of bay round a clear bright pond, the earliest haunt of the <name ref="#swallow">swallows</name>. A deep, woody green lane, such as <sic><persName ref="#Hobbema_M">Hobbima</persName></sic> or Ruydsdael<note resp="#scw"><persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> could be referring to either <persName ref="#Ruysdael_Jacob">Jacob Ruysdael</persName> or <persName ref="#Ruysdael_Salomon">Salomon Ruysdael</persName>.</note> might have painted, a lane that hints of <name ref="#nightingale">nightingales</name>, forms one boundary of the garden, and a sloping meadow the other; whilst the cottage itself, a low thatched irregular building, backed by a blooming orchard, and covered with <name ref="#honeysuckle">honeysuckle</name> and <name ref="#jessamine">jessamine</name>, looks like the chosen abode of snugness and comfort. And so it is. </p>
                <p><persName ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">Dame Wilson</persName> was a respected servant in a most respectable family, where she passed all the early part of her life, and which she quitted only on her marriage with a <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_John_OV">man of character and industry</rs>, and of that peculiar universality of genius which forms, what is called in country phrase, a handy fellow. He could do any sort of work; was thatcher, carpenter, bricklayer,<pb n="18"/> painter, gardener, game-keeper, <quote>every thing by turns, and nothing long.</quote><!--scw 6/17/23: Still trying to nail down this quote. Connected to Byron, or he's quoting someone. See Blessington, Conversations of Byron. If from Blessington, too late for MRM--> No job came amiss to him. He killed <name ref="#pig">pigs</name>, mended shoes, cleaned clocks, doctored <name ref="#cow">cows</name>, <name ref="#dog">dogs</name>, and <name ref="#horse">horses</name>, and even went as far as bleeding and drawing teeth in his experiments on the human subject. In addition to these multifarious talents, he was ready, obliging, and unfearing; jovial withal, and fond of good-fellowship; and endowed with a promptness of resource which made him the general adviser of the stupid, the puzzled, and the timid. He was universally admitted to be the cleverest man in the parish; and his death, which happened about ten years ago, in consequence of standing in the water, drawing a pond for one neighbour, at a time when he was over-heated by loading hay for another, made quite a gap in our <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">village</placeName> commonwealth. <persName ref="#Wilson_John_OV">John Wilson</persName> had no rival, and has had no successor;—for the <persName ref="#Ellis_Robert_OV">Robert Ellis</persName>, whom certain youngsters would fain exalt to a co-partnery of fame, is simply nobody—a <persName ref="#Ellis_Robert_OV">bell-ringer, a ballad-singer—a troller of profane catches—a fiddler—a bruiser—a loller on alehouse benches—a teller of good stories—a mimic—a poet!</persName>—What is all this to compare with the solid parts of <persName ref="#Wilson_John_OV">John Wilson</persName>? Whose clock hath <persName ref="#Ellis_Robert_OV">Robert Ellis</persName> cleaned?—whose windows hath he mended?—whose <name ref="#dog">dog</name> hath he broken?—whose <name ref="#pig">pigs</name> hath he rung?—whose pond hath he fished?—whose hay hath he saved?—whose <name ref="#cow">cow</name> hath he cured?—whose calf hath<pb n="19"/> he killed?—whose teeth hath he drawn? whom hath he bled? Tell me that, irreverent whipsters! No! <persName ref="#Wilson_John_OV">John Wilson</persName> is not to be replaced. He was missed by the whole <placeName ref="#Shinfield_parish">parish</placeName>; and most of all he was missed at home. His excellent <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">wife</rs> was left the sole guardian and protector of two fatherless girls; one an <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Susan_OV">infant</rs> at her knee, the other a pretty handy <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">lass about nine years old</rs>. Cast thus upon the world, there must have been much to endure, much to suffer; but it was borne with a smiling patience, a hopeful cheeriness of spirit, and a decent pride, which seemed to command success as well as respect in their struggle for independence. Without assistance of any sort, by needle-work, by washing and mending lace and fine linen, and other by skilful and profitable labours, and by the produce of her orchard and poultry, <persName ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">Dame Wilson</persName> contrived to maintain herself and <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV #Wilson_Susan_OV">her children</rs> in their old comfortable home. There was no visible change; she and the <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV #Wilson_Susan_OV">little girls</rs> were as neat as ever; the house had still within and without the same sunshiny cleanliness, and the garden was still famous over all other gardens for its <name ref="#clove">cloves</name>, and <name ref="#stock">stocks</name>, and double wall-flowers. But the sweetest flower of the garden, the joy and pride of her <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">mother</rs>’s heart, was her daughter <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>. Well might she be proud of her! At sixteen <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah Wilson</persName> was, beyond a doubt, the prettiest girl in the village, and the best. Her beauty was quite in a different style from the common <pb n="20"/>country rosebud—far more choice and rare. Its chief characteristic was modesty. A light youthful figure, exquisitely graceful and rapid in all its movements; springy, elastic, and buoyant as a bird, and almost as shy; a fair innocent face, with downcast blue eyes, and smiles and blushes coming and going almost with her thoughts; a low soft voice, sweet even in its monosyllables; a dress remarkable for neatness and propriety, and borrowing from her delicate beauty an air of superiority not its own;—such was the outward woman of <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>. Her mind was very like her person; modest, graceful, gentle, affectionate, grateful, and generous above all. The generosity of the poor is always a very real and fine thing: they give what they want; and <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> was of all poor people the most generous. She loved to give; it was her pleasure, her luxury. Rosy-cheeked apples, plums with the bloom on them, nosegays of <name ref="#clove">cloves</name> and blossomed <name ref="#myrtle">myrtle</name>; these were offerings which <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> delighted to bring to those whom she loved, or those who had shown her kindness; whilst to others, who needed other attentions than fruit and flowers, she would give her time, her assistance, her skill; for <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> inherited her <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">mother</rs>’s<!-- 2023-05-26 ebb with scw lmw slc: We think to change the xml:ids for all OV characters to end with _OV, so it will be easy to distinguish OV fictional character references from fictional references external to OV such as Oberon and Titania etc. We are changing the refs in these old sketches to match. --><!--scw 6/20/23: Making the changes in the files that need it, and continuing the practice--> dexterity in feminine employments, with something of her <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_John_OV">father</rs>’s versatile power. Besides being an excellent laundress, she was accomplished in all the arts of the needle, millinery, dress-making, and plain work; a capital cutter-<pb n="21"/>out, an incomparable mender, and endowed with a gift of altering, which made old things better than new. She had no rival at a <emph rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="it">rifacimento</foreign></emph>,<note resp="#scw">According to the OED, <quote corresp="#OED">A new version or remodelling of a literary or artistic work.</quote> In this case, <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName> extends the meaning to dress-making.</note> as half the turned gowns on the common can witness. As a dairy-woman, and a rearer of <name ref="#pig">pigs</name> and poultry, she was equally successful: none of her <name ref="#duck_farm">ducks</name> and <name ref="#turkey">turkeys</name> ever died of neglect or carelessness, or, to use the phrase of the poultry-yard on such occasions, of <quote><soCalled>ill luck</soCalled></quote>. <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>’s fowls never dreamed of sliding out of the world in such an ignoble way; they all lived to be killed, to make a noise at their deaths, as <name ref="#chicken">chickens</name> should do. She was also a famous <quote><soCalled>scholar;</soCalled></quote> kept accounts, wrote bills, read letters, and answered them; was a trusty accomptant, and a safe confidante. There was no end to <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>’s usefulness or <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>’s kindness; and her prudence was equal to either. Except to be kind or useful, she never left her home; attended no fairs, or revels, or Mayings; went no where but to <orgName ref="#villageChurch_OV">church</orgName>; and seldom made a nearer approach to rustic revelry than by standing at her own garden-gate on a Sunday evening, with her <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Susan_OV">little sister</rs> in her hand, to look at the lads and lasses on the green. In short, our <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">village beauty</rs> had fairly reached her twentieth year without a sweetheart, without the slightest suspicion of her having ever written a love-letter on her own account; when, all on a sudden, appearances changed. She was missing at the <quote>accustomed gate</quote>;<!--scw: I haven’t yet been able to identify this quote--> and one had seen a <pb n="22"/><rs type="person" ref="#Smith_William_OV">young man</rs> go into <persName ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">Dame Wilson’s</persName>; and another had descried a <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_William_OV">trim elastic figure</rs> walking, not unaccompanied, down the shady lane. Matters were quite clear. <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> had gotten a lover; and, when poor little <persName ref="#Wilson_Susan_OV">Susan</persName>, who, deserted by <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">her sister</rs>, ventured to peep rather nearer to the gay groupe, was laughingly questioned on the subject, the hesitating No, and the half Yes,<!--scw 6/19/23: These words of quoted speech, No and Yes, are spoken but not in quotation marks, so I'm leaving them without the <said> element.--> of the <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Susan_OV">smiling child</rs>, were equally conclusive. </p>
                <p>Since the new marriage act*,<note type="author" anchored="true">It is necessary to observe that this story was written during the short operation of that curious experiment in legislation.</note> we, who belong to country magistrates, have gained a priority over the rest of the <orgName ref="#Shinfield_parish">parish</orgName> in matrimonial news.

The law was abolished in <date when="1823">1823</date>.</note> <!--scw: Ref in part: Boulton, Jeremy. “Marriage Act.” Oxford Companion to British History. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2009.

One Saturday, at the usual hour, the limping <persName ref="#Clerk_OV">clerk</persName> made his appearance; and, walking through our little hall, I saw a <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_William_OV">fine athletic young man</rs>, the very image of health and vigour, mental and bodily, holding the hand of a <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">young woman</rs>, who, with her head half buried in a <name ref="#geranium">geranium</name> in the window, was turning bashfully away, listening, and yet not seeming to listen, to his tender whispers. The shrinking grace of that <pb n="23"/>bending figure was not to be mistaken. <said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true"><persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>!</said> and she went aside with me, and a rapid series of questions and answers conveyed the story of courtship. <said who="#Wilson_Hannah_OV" direct="false"><persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName> was,</said> said <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>,<said who="#Wilson_Hannah_OV" direct="false"> a journeyman hatter in <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName> He had walked over one Sunday evening to see the cricketing, and then he came again. <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">Her mother</rs> liked him. Every body liked her <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName>—and she had promised—she was going—was it wrong?”</said>—<said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true">Oh no!—and where are you to live?</said>—<said who="#Wilson_Hannah_OV" direct="true"><persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName> has got a room in <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B</placeName>. He works for <persName ref="#Smith_theHatter_OV">Mr. Smith</persName>, the rich hatter in the market-place, and <persName ref="#Smith_theHatter_OV">Mr. Smith</persName> speaks of him—oh, so well! But <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName> will not tell me where our room is. I suppose in some narrow street or lane, which he is afraid I shall not like, as our common is so pleasant. He little thinks—any where</said>—She stopped suddenly; but her blush and her clasped hands finished the sentence, <said who="#Wilson_Hannah_OV" direct="true">any where with him!</said>—<said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true">And when is the happy day?”</said>—<said who="#Smith_William_OV" direct="true">On Monday fortnight, Madam,</said> said the <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_William_OV">bridegroom elect</rs>, advancing with the little <persName ref="#Clerk_OV">clerk</persName> to summon <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> to the parlour, <said who="#Smith_William_OV" direct="true">the earliest day possible.”</said> He drew her arm through his, and we parted.</p>
                <p>The Monday <date dur="P14D">fortnight</date> was a glorious morning; one of those rare <date when="--11">November</date> days when the sky and the air are soft and bright as in <date when="--04">April</date>. <said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true">What a beautiful day for <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah!</persName></said> was the first exclamation of the breakfast-table. <said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true">Did she tell you where they should dine?</said><pb n="24"/>—<said>No, Ma’am; I forgot to ask.</said>—<said who="#OVNarratorsFather" direct="true">I can tell you,</said> said the <rs type="person" ref="#OVNarratorsFather">master of the house</rs>, with somewhat of good-humoured importance in his air, somewhat of the look of a man who, having kept a secret as long as it was necessary, is not sorry to get rid of the burthen. <said who="#OVNarratorsFather" direct="true">I can tell you: in <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName>.</said>—<said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true">In <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName>!</said>—<said who="#OVNarratorsFather" direct="true">Yes. <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Your little favourite</rs> has been in high luck. She has married the only son of one of the best and richest men in <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>, <persName ref="#Smith_theHatter_OV">Mr. Smith</persName>, the great hatter. It is quite a romance,</said> continued he: <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William Smith</persName> walked over one Sunday evening to see a match at cricket. He saw our pretty <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>, and forgot to look at the <orgName type="person" ref="#Cricketers_OV">cricketers</orgName>. After having gazed his fill, he approached to address her, and the <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">little damsel</rs> was off like a bird. <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName> did not like her the less for that, and thought of her the more. He came again and again; and at last contrived to tame this <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">wild dove</rs>, and even to get the <emph rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="fr">entree</foreign></emph> of the cottage. Hearing <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> talk, is not the way to fall out of love with her. So <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName>, at last finding his case serious, laid the matter before <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_theHatter_OV">his father</rs>, and requested his consent to the marriage. <persName ref="#Smith_theHatter_OV">Mr. Smith</persName> was at first a little startled; but <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName> is an only son, and an excellent son; and, after talking with me, and looking at <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>, (I believe her sweet face was the more eloquent advocate of the two,) he relented; and having a spice of <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_William_OV">his son</rs>’s romance, finding that he had not mentioned his situation in life, he made a point of its<pb n="25"/> being kept secret till the wedding-day. We have managed the business of settlements; and <persName ref="#Smith_William_OV">William</persName>, having discovered that his <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">fair bride</rs> has some curiosity to see <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName>, (a curiosity, by the bye, which I suspect she owes to you or poor <persName ref="#Lucy_OV_fict">Lucy</persName>,) intends taking her thither for a <date dur="P14D">fortnight</date>. He will then bring her home to one of the best houses in <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>, a fine garden, fine furniture, fine clothes, fine servants, and more money than she will know what to do with. Really the surprise of <rs type="person" ref="#Hoggins_Sarah"><rs type="person" ref="#Cecil_Henry">Lord E.</rs>’s farmer’s daughter</rs>, when, thinking she had married his steward, he brought her to <placeName ref="#Burghley_House"><sic>Burleigh</sic></placeName>, and installed her as its mistress, could hardly have been greater. I hope the shock will not kill <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> though, as is said to have been the case with that <rs type="person" ref="#Hoggins_Sarah">poor lady</rs>.—<said who="#OVNarrator" direct="true">Oh no! <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> loves <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_William_OV">her husband</rs> too well. Any where with him!</said></p>
                <p>And I was right. <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName> has survived the shock. She is returned to <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>, and I have been to call on her. I never saw any thing so delicate and bride-like as she looked in her white gown and her lace mob, in a room light and simple, and tasteful and elegant, with nothing fine except some beautiful green-house plants. Her reception was a charming mixture of sweetness and modesty, a little more respectful than usual, and far more shamefaced! Poor thing! her cheeks must have pained her! But this was the only difference. In every thing else she is still the same <persName ref="#Wilson_Hannah_OV">Hannah</persName>, and has lost none of<pb n="26"/> her old habits of kindness and gratitude. She was making a handsome matronly cap, evidently for <rs type="person" ref="#Wilson_Dame_OV">her mother</rs>, and spoke, even with tears, of <rs type="person" ref="#Smith_theHatter_OV">her new father</rs>’s goodness to her and to <persName ref="#Wilson_Susan_OV">Susan</persName>. She would fetch the cake and wine herself, and would gather, in spite of all remonstrance, some of her choice flowers as a parting nosegay.
