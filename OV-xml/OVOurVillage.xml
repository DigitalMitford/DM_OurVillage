                <head>OUR VILLAGE.</head>
                <p>Of all situations for a constant residence, that which appears to me most
                    delightful is a little village far
                    in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but
                    of cottages and cottage-like houses, <quote>messuages or tenements</quote>, <!-- 2017-01-03 bas: format? --> as
                    a friend of mine calls such ignoble and non-descript
                    dwellings, with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in
                    our garden; a little world of our own, close-packed
                    and insulated like <name ref="#ant">ants</name> in an ant-hill, or <name ref="#bee">bees</name> in a hive, or
                    <name ref="#sheep">sheep</name> in a fold, or nuns in a convent, or sailors in a ship; where we know every one, are known to
                    every one, interested in every one, and authorised to hope that every one feels
                    an interest in us. How pleasant it is to slide into these fine-hearted feelings
                    from the kindly and unconscious influence of habit, and to learn to know and to
                    love the people about us, with all their peculiarities, just as we learn to know
                    and to love the nooks and turns of the shady lanes and
                    sunny commons that we pass every day. Even in books <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I</persName> like
                    a con-<pb n="2"/>fined locality, and so do the critics when
                    they talk of the unities<note resp="#scw">The unities is an Aristotelian concept that holds that tragedy must unfold within three unified dimensions: unity of time, unity of place, and unity of action.</note>. Nothing is so tiresome as to be
                    whirled half over <placeName ref="#Europe">Europe</placeName> at the chariot-wheels of a hero, to go to sleep at <placeName ref="#Vienna">Vienna</placeName>,
                    and awaken at <placeName ref="#Madrid">Madrid</placeName>; it produces a real fatigue, a
                    weariness of spirit. On the other hand, nothing is so delightful as to sit down
                    in a country village in one of <persName ref="#Austen_Jane">Miss Austen</persName>’s delicious novels, quite sure before
                    we leave it to become intimate with every spot and every person it contains; or

                        sailor! we never sympathise for a moment in <rs
                            type="person" ref="#Robinson_Crusoe">our hero</rs>’s want of company, and are quite grieved when he

And a small
                    neighbourhood is as good in sober waking reality as in poetry or prose; a
                        village neighbourhood, such as this <pb n="3"

                    <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">hamlet</placeName> in which I write, a long, straggling, winding
                    street at the bottom of a fine eminence, with a road
                    through it, always abounding in carts, <orgName type="person" ref="#OV_horsemen">horsemen,</orgName> and
                    carriages, and lately enlivened by a stage-coach from

                        <placeName ref="#S_city_OV">S——</placeName>, which passed through about ten days ago, and
                    will I suppose return some time or other. There are coaches of all varieties
                    now-a-days; perhaps this may be intended for a monthly diligence, or a fortnightly
                    fly. Will you walk with me through <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">our
                        village</placeName>, courteous reader? The journey is not long. We will
                    begin at the lower end, and proceed up the hill.</p>
               <p>The tidy square red cottage on the right hand, with the long well-stocked
                    garden by the side of the road, belongs to a <persName ref="#RetiredPublican_OV">retired publican</persName> from a neighbouring town; a substantial person with a <persName ref="#RetiredPublicansWife_OV">comely wife</persName>; one who piques
                    himself on independence and idleness, talks politics, reads
                    newspapers, hates the minister<note resp="#scw">Probably refers to <persName ref="#Liverpool_Earl">Lord Liverpool</persName>, whose party had won the <date when="1820">1820</date> general election, and he was returned to serve as Prime Minister.</note>, and cries out for
                            reform. He
                    introduced into our peaceful vicinage the rebellious innovation of an
                    illumination on <label corresp="#Qu_Caroline_Affair">the queen’s acquittal</label>. Remonstrance and persuasion were in
                    vain; he talked of liberty and broken windows—so we all lighted up. Oh! how he
                    shone that night with candles and laurel, and white bows, and gold paper, and a
                    transparency (originally designed for a pockethandkerchief) with
                    a flaming portrait of <rs type="person" ref="#Queen_Caroline">Her Majesty,</rs>
                    hatted and feathered, in red ochre. He had no rival in <pb n="4"/><placeName

                    their best crackers to be expended in his honour, and he gave them full sixpence

                    idleness. He hangs over his gate, and tries to entice passengers to stop and
                    chat; he volunteers little jobs all round, smokes <name ref="#cherry_wild">cherrytrees</name> to cure the

This is firing an error because you’re referring to the organization of Shinfield parish.

                            garden to-day, and shall enchant him with the intelligence. He even assists <persName ref="#RetiredPublicansWife_OV">his
                        wife</persName> in her sweepings and dustings. Poor man! he is a very
                    respectable person, and would be a very happy one, if he would add a little
                    employment to his dignity. It would be the salt of life to him.</p> 
                <p>Next to his house, though parted from it by another long garden with a <name ref="#yew_tree">yew</name> arbour at the end, is the pretty dwelling of the  <persName ref="#Shoemaker_OV">shoemaker</persName>, a pale, sickly-looking, black-haired
                    man, the very model of sober industry. There he sits in his little
                        shop from early morning till late at night. An earthquake would
                    hardly stir him: the illumination did not. He stuck immoveably to his last, from
                    the first gradual lighting up, through the long<pb n="5"/> blaze and the gradual decay,
                    till his large solitary candle was the only light in the place. One cannot
                    conceive any thing more perfect than the contempt which the <rs type="person"
                        ref="#RetiredPublican_OV">man of
                        transparencies</rs> and the <rs type="person"

                    that evening. There was at least as much vanity in the sturdy industry as in the
                    strenuous idleness, for our <persName ref="#Shoemaker_OV"
                        >shoemaker</persName> is a man of substance: he employs <orgName type="person" ref="#journeymen_shoemakers_OV">three
                    journeymen</orgName>,
                    two lame, and one a dwarf, so that his shop looks like an hospital; he
                    has purchased the lease of his commodious dwelling, some even say that he has
                    bought it out and out; and he has only one pretty <persName ref="#ShoemakersDaughter_OV">daughter</persName>, a light,
                    delicate, fair-haired girl of fourteen, the champion, protectress, and
                    playfellow of every brat under three years old, whom she jumps, dances, dandles,
                    and feeds all day long. She is a very attractive person, is that <persName ref="#ShoemakersDaughter_OV">child-loving
                        girl</persName>. I have never seen any one in her station who possessed so
                    thoroughly that undefinable charm, the lady-look. See her on a
                    Sunday in her simplicity and her white frock, and she might pass for an earl’s
                    daughter. She likes flowers, too, and has a
                    profusion of white <name ref="#stock">stocks</name> under her
                    window, as pure and delicate as herself.</p>
                <p> The first house on the opposite side of the way is the <persName ref="#Blacksmith_OV">blacksmith</persName>’s; a gloomy dwelling,
                    where the sun never seems to shine; dark and smoky within and without, like a
                    forge. The <persName ref="#Blacksmith_OV">blacksmith</persName> is a high officer
                    in <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">our <pb n="6"/>little state</placeName>, nothing less than a constable;
                    but, alas! alas! when tumults arise, and the <rs type="person" ref="#Blacksmith_OV">constable</rs> is called for, he will commonly be found in the
                    thickest of the fray. Lucky would it be for his <persName ref="#BlacksmithsWife_OV">wife</persName> and <orgName type="person" ref="#BlacksmithsChildren_OV"
                        >her eight children</orgName> if there were no public-house in
                    the land: an inveterate inclination to enter those bewitching doors is <rs type="person"
                        ref="#Blacksmith_OV">Mr. Constable’s</rs> only fault.</p>
                <p>Next to this official dwelling is a spruce brick tenement, red, high, and narrow,
                    boasting one above another three sash-windows, the only sash-windows in the
                    village, with a <name ref="#clematis">clematis</name> on one side and a
                        <name ref="#rose">rose</name> on the other, tall and narrow
                    like itself. That slender mansion has a fine genteel look. The little parlour
                    seems made for <persName ref="#Hogarth">Hogarth’s</persName>
                    old maid and her stunted footboy<note resp="#scw">Likely a reference to <persName ref="#Hogarth">Hogarth</persName>'s painting Morning, which is part of the series, <title level="m" ref="#FourTimesDay_WH">Four Times of the Day</title>.</note>

                    by honours, and a little snug quiet scandal between the deals; for affected
                    gentility and real starvation. This should have been its destiny; but fate has

                <p>Then comes the village shop, like other village shops,
                    multifarious as a bazaar; a repository for bread, shoes, tea,

                    every thing, in short, except the one particular thing which you happen to want
                    at the moment, and will be sure not to <pb n="7"/>find. The people are civil and

                    Nature revenged herself in her own sweet and gracious manner; fresh leaves

                    her, the grave romp with her; does any thing she pleases; is absolutely
                    irresistible. Her chief attraction lies in her exceeding power of loving, and
                    her firm reliance on the love and indulgence of others. How impossible it would
                    be to disappoint the <rs type="person" ref="#Lizzy_OV">dear little girl</rs> when she runs to meet you, slides her

                    wonderful play of countenance. She has the imperial attitudes too, and loves to
                    stand with her hands behind her, or folded over her bosom; and sometimes, when
                    she has a little touch of shyness, she clasps them together on the top of her
                    head, pressing down her shining curls, and looking so exquisitely pretty! Yes,
                    <persName ref="#Lizzy_OV">Lizzy</persName> is <rs type="person" ref="#Lizzy_OV">queen of the village</rs>! She has but one rival in

                    much her friend, who re-<pb n="11"/>sembles her in beauty and strength, in

                    over the human. They are both coming with me, <persName ref="#Lizzy_OV">Lizzy</persName> and

                        round the corner, ending in a picturesque
                    wheeler’s shop. The
                        dwelling-house is more ambitious. Look at the fine
                    flowered window-blinds, the green door with the brass knocker, and the somewhat
                    prim but very civil <persName ref="#WheelersWife_OV">person</persName>, who is sending off a

                    to marry, or to bury, as the case may
                    require. Never were better or kinder people than his <rs type="person" ref="#Wheeler_OV">host</rs>
                    and <rs type="person" ref="#WheelersWife_OV">hostess</rs>; and there is a fine reflection of clerical

                    The <persName ref="#Curate_OV">curate</persName> is nothing to him. He is fit to be perpetual

                    clearly defined and relieved is the figure of the <persName ref="#Evans_John_OV">man</persName> who
                    is just coming down! It is poor <persName ref="#Evans_John_OV">John Evans</persName>, the
                        gardener—an excellent gardener till about ten years
                    ago, when he lost his <persName ref="#Evans_JohnWife_OV">wife</persName>, and became<pb n="13"/> insane.
                    He was sent to <orgName ref="#St_Lukes_Hospital">St. Luke’s</orgName>, and dismissed as cured; but his
                    power was gone and his strength; he could no longer manage a garden, nor submit
                    to the restraint, nor encounter the fatigue of regular employment; so he
                    retreated to the <orgName ref="#workhouse_OV">workhouse</orgName>, the pensioner and factotum of the

                    some fantastic and impracticable plan, and lost to present objects; but he is
                    perfectly harmless, and full of a child-like simplicity, a smiling
                    contentedness, a most touching gratitude. Every one is kind to <persName ref="#Evans_John_OV">John

                    better feeling. I know nobody who inspires so deep and tender a pity; he
                    improves all aroud him. He is useful, too, to the extent of his little power;
                    will do any thing, but loves gardening best, and still
                    piques himself on his old arts of pruning
                    fruit-trees, and raising <name ref="#cucumber">cucumbers</name>.
                    He is the happiest of men just now, for he has the management of a

                <p> We are now on the very brow of the eminence, close to the
                            Hill-house and its
                                beautiful garden. On the outer edge of the
                    paling, hanging over the bank
                    that<pb n="14"/> skirts the road, is an old <name ref="#thorn">thorn</name>—such
                    a <name ref="#thorn">thorn</name>! The long sprays covered with snowy
                    blossoms, so graceful, so elegant, so lightsome, and
                    yet so rich! There only wants a pool under the <name ref="#thorn">thorn</name> to give a still lovelier reflection, quivering and
                    trembling, like a tuft of feathers, whiter and greener than the life, and more
                    prettily mixed with the bright blue sky. There should indeed be a
                    pool; but on the dark grass-plat,
                    under the high bank, which is crowned by that
                        magnificent plume, there is something that does almost as
                        well,—<persName ref="#Lizzy_OV">Lizzy</persName> and <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May-flower</persName> in the

                        place;</quote><!--scw: ED NOTE: A quotation from Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene, Book I. -->
                    <persName ref="#Lizzy_OV">Lizzy</persName> rolling, laughing, clapping her hands, and glowing
                    like a rose;
                    <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May-flower</persName> playing about her like summer lightning,
                    dazzling the eyes with her sudden turns, her leaps, her bounds, her attacks and
                    her escapes. She darts round the lovely little <rs type="person" ref="#Lizzy_OV">girl</rs>, with
                    the same momentary touch that the swallow skims over the
                    water, and has exactly the same power of flight, the same matchless ease and
                    strength and grace. What a pretty picture they would make; what a pretty
                    foreground they do make to the real landscape! The road winding down the
                        hill with a slight bend, like that in the
                    High-street at <placeName ref="#Oxford_city">Oxford</placeName>; a
                     waggon slowly ascending, and a

                    <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May-flower</persName> will certainly desert you to have a gambol with
                    that blood-horse!) half-way down, just at the turn, the

                    the very image of comfort and content; farther down, on the opposite side, the
                        small white dwelling of the little
                    <persName ref="#Mason_OV">mason</persName>; then the <name ref="#lime_tree">limes</name> and the
                    rope-walk; then the village
                        street, peeping through the trees, whose
                    clustering tops hide all but the chimneys and various roofs of the houses, and
                    here and there some angle of a wall: farther on, the elegant town of
                    <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B——</placeName>, with its fine old
                    church-towers and spires; the whole view shut in by a range of
                    chalky hills; and over every part of the picture trees, so profusely scattered, that it appears like a
                    woodland scene, with glades and
                        villages intermixed. The trees
                    are of all kinds and all hues, chiefly the finely-shaped <name ref="#elm_tree"
                        >elm</name>, of so deep and bright a green, the tips of whose high outer
                    branches drop down with such a crisp and garland-like richness, and the <name ref="#oak_tree">oak</name>, whose stately form is just now so splendidly adorned
                    by the sunny colouring of the young leaves. Turning again up the
                    hill, we find ourselves on that peculiar charm of
                    English scenery, a green common, divided by the road; the
                    right side fringed by hedge-rows and trees, with cottages and 
                        farm-houses irregularly placed, and terminated by a double avenue of
                            noble <name ref="#oak_tree">oaks</name>; the left, prettier still, dappled by bright
                    pools of water, and islands of 
                    cottages and cottage-gardens, and sinking
                    gradually down to corn-fields and
                    meadows, and an old
                        farm-house, with pointed roofs and clustered chimneys, looking out<pb
                            n="16"/>from its blooming orchard, and backed by
                    woody hills. The common is itself
                    the prettiest part of the prospect; half covered with low <name ref="#furze"
                        >furze</name>, whose golden blossoms reflect so intensely the last beams of
                    the setting sun, and alive with <name ref="#cow">cows</name> and 
                    <name ref="#sheep">sheep</name>, and two sets of <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCricketers">cricketers</orgName>: one
                    of young men, surrounded with

                    on the grass, all taking a delighted interest in the game;
                    the other, a <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCountryBoys">merry groupe of little boys</orgName>, at humble
                    distance, for whom even cricket is scarcely lively enough, shouting,
                    leaping, and enjoying themselves to their hearts’ content. But
                        <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCricketers">cricketers</orgName> and <orgName type="person" ref="#OVCountryBoys">country boys</orgName> are too
                    important persons in our <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross">village</placeName> to be talked of merely
                    as figures in the landscape. They deserve an individual introduction—an essay to
                    themselves—and they shall have it. No fear of forgetting the good-humoured faces
                    that meet us in our walks every day.<pb n="17"/></p>
