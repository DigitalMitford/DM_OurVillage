            <p>The lords of the creation, who are generally (to do them justice) tenacious enough of
               their distinctive and peculiar faculties and powers, have yet by common consent made
               over to the females the single gift of loquacity. Every man thinks and says that
               every woman talks more than he: it is the creed of the whole sex,—the debates and law
               reports notwithstanding. And every masculine eye that has scanned my title has
               already, I doubt not, looked to the errata, suspecting a mistake in the gender; but
               it is their misconception, not my mistake. I do not (Heaven forbid!) intend to impugn
               or abrogate our female privilege; I do not dispute that we do excel, generally
               speaking, in the use of the tongue; I only mean to assert that one gentleman does
               exist, (whom I have the pleasure of knowing intimately,) who stands pre-eminent and
               unrivalled in the art of talking,—unmatched and unapproached by man, woman, or child.
               Since the decease of my poor friend <quote>“<persName ref="#talking_lady_fict_OV">the Talking Lady</persName>,”</quote> who dropped down speech<pb
                  n="214"/>less in the midst of a long story about nine weeks ago, and was
               immediately known to be dead by her silence, I should be at a loss where to seek a
               competitor to contend with him in a race of words, and I should be still more puzzled
               to find one that can match him in wit, pleasantry, or good-humour.</p>
            <p>My friend is usually called <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry L.</persName>, for, though a man of substance, a lord of land,
               a magistrate, a field officer of militia, nobody ever dreamed of calling him <emph rend="italics">Mister</emph>
               or major, or by any such derogatory title—he is and will be all his life plain <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry</persName>,
               the name of universal good-will. He is indeed the pleasantest fellow that lives. His
               talk (one can hardly call it conversation, as that would seem to imply another
               interlocutor, something like reciprocity) is an incessant flow of good things, like
               <persName ref="#Congreve_Wm">Congreve</persName>’s comedies without a replying speaker, or <persName ref="#Miller_Joe">Joe Miller</persName> laid into one; and its
               perpetual stream is not lost and dispersed by diffusion, but runs in one constant
               channel, playing and sparkling like a fountain, the delight and ornament of our good
               <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">town of B.</placeName></p>
            <p><persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry L.</persName> is a perfect example of provincial reputation, of local fame. There is not
               an urchin in the town that has not heard of him, nor an old woman that does not
               chuckle by anticipation at his approach. The citizens of <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName> are as proud of him as
               the citizens of <placeName ref="#Antwerp_city">Antwerp</placeName> were of the <title ref="#Chapeau_de_Paille_painting"><foreign xml:lang="fr"><emph rend="italics">Chapeau de Paille</emph></foreign></title>, and they have<pb n="215"/> the
               advantage of the luckless Flemings in the certainty that their boast is not to be
               purchased. <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry</persName>, like the <title ref="#Chapeau_de_Paille_painting">Flemish Beauty</title>, is native to the spot; for he was born at
               <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>, educated at <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>, married at <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>—though, as his beautiful <persName ref="#L_Harry_wife_OV">wife</persName> brought him a good
               estate in a distant part of the country, there seemed at that epoch of his history
               some danger of his being lost to our ancient borough;<note resp="#scw">Mitford likely means <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName>, which was considered an ancient borough.</note> but he is a social and
               gregarious animal; so he leaves his pretty place in <placeName ref="#Devonshire_county">Devonshire</placeName> to take care of
               itself, and lives here in the midst of a hive. His tastes are not at all rural. He is
               no sportsman, no farmer, no lover of strong exercise. When at <placeName ref="#B_city_OV">B.</placeName>, his walks are quite
               regular; from his own house, on one side of the town, to a gossip-shop called
               <quote>“literary”</quote> on the other, where he talks and reads newspapers, and others read
               newspapers and listen: thence he proceeds to another house of news, similar in kind,
               though differing in name, in an opposite quarter, where he and his hearers undergo
               the same process, and then he returns home, forming a pretty exact triangle of about
               half a mile. This is his daily exercise, or rather his daily walk; of exercise he
               takes abundance, not only in talking, (though that is nearly as good to open the
               chest as the dumb-bells,) but in a general restlessness and fidgetiness of person,
               the result of his ardent and nervous temperament, which can hardly endure repose of
               mind or body. He neither gives rest nor takes it. His<pb n="216"/> company is,
               indeed, in one sense (only one) fatiguing. Listening to him tires you like a journey.
               You laugh till you are forced to lie down. The <orgName type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_medMen_OV">medical gentlemen</orgName> of the place are
               aware of this, and are accustomed to exhort <orgName type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_patients_OV">delicate patients</orgName> to abstain from <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry</persName>’s
               society, just as they caution them against temptations in point of amusement or of
               diet—pleasant but dangerous. <orgName type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_cholericGents_OV">Choleric gentlemen</orgName> should also avoid him, and such as
               love to have the last word; for, though never provoked himself, I cannot deny that he
               is occasionally tolerably provoking,—in politics especially—(and he is an
               ultra-liberal, quotes <persName ref="#Cobbett_Wm">Cobbett</persName>, and goes rather too far)—in politics he loves to put
               his antagonist in a fume, and generally succeeds, though it is nearly the only
               subject on which he ever listens to an answer—chiefly I believe for the sake of a
               reply, which is commonly some trenchant repartee, that cuts off the poor answer’s
               head like a razor. Very determined speakers would also do well to eschew his
               company—though in general I never met with any talker to whom other talkers were so
               ready to give way; perhaps because he keeps them in such incessant laughter, that
               they are not conscious of their silence. To himself the number of his listeners is
               altogether unimportant. His speech flows not from vanity or lust of praise, but from
               sheer necessity ;—the reservoir is full, and runs over. When he has no one else to
               talk to, he can be content with his own company,<pb n="217"/> and talks to himself,
               being beyond a doubt greater in a soliloquy than any man off the stage. Where he is
               not known, this habit sometimes occasions considerable consternation, and very
               ridiculous mistakes. He has been taken alternately for an actor, a poet, a man in
               love, and a man beside himself. Once in particular, at <placeName ref="#Windsor_city">Windsor</placeName>, he greatly alarmed a
               <rs type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_soldier_OV">philanthropic sentinel</rs>, by holding forth at his usual rate whilst pacing the terrace
               alone; and but for the opportune arrival of <orgName type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_WindsorFriends_OV">his party</orgName>, and their assurances that it
               was only <said who="#Talk_Gent_WindsorFriends_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“the gentleman’s way,”</said> there was some danger that the <rs type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_soldier_OV">benevolent soldier</rs>
               might have been tempted to desert his post to take care of him. Even after this
               explanation, he looked with a doubtful eye at <rs type="person" ref="#L_Harry_OV">our friend</rs>, who was haranguing himself
               in great style, sighed and shook his head, and finally implored us to look well after
               him till he should be safe off the terrace.—<said who="#Talk_Gent_soldier_OV" direct="true" aloud="true">“You see, Ma’am,” observed the
                  <rs type="person" ref="#Talk_Gent_soldier_OV">philanthropist in scarlet</rs>, “it is an awkward place for any body troubled with
               vagaries. Suppose the poor soul should take a fancy to jump over the wall!”</said></p>
            <p>In his externals he is a well-looking gentleman of forty, or thereabout; rather thin
               and rather pale, but with no appearance of ill health, nor any other peculiarity,
               except the remarkable circumstance of the lashes of one eye being white, which gives
               a singular non-resemblance to his organs of vision. Every one perceives<pb n="218"/>
               the want of uniformity, and few detect the cause. Some suspect him of what farriers
               call a wall-eye; some think he squints. He himself talks familiarly of his two eyes,
               the black and the white, and used to liken them to those of our fine Persian cat,
               (now, alas! no more,) who had, in common with his feline countrymen, one eye blue as
               a sapphire, the other yellow as a topaz. The dissimilarity certainly rather spoils
               his beauty, but greatly improves his wit,—I mean the sense of his wit in others. It
               arrests attention, and predisposes to laughter; is an outward and visible sign of the
               comical. No common man has two such eyes. They are made for fun.</p>
            <p>In his occupations and pleasures <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry</persName> is pretty much like other provincial
               gentlemen: loves a rubber, and jests all through at aces, kings, queens, and knaves,
               bad cards and good, at winning and losing, scolding and praise;—loves a play, at
               which he out-talks the actors whilst on the stage,—to say nothing of the advantage he
               has over them in the intervals between the acts;—loves music, as a good accompaniment
               to his grand solo;—loves a contested election above all. That is his real
               element,—that din and uproar and riot and confusion! To ride that whirlwind and
               direct that storm is his triumph of triumphs! He would make a great sensation in
               parliament himself, and a pleasant one. (By the way, he was once in danger of
                  being<pb n="219"/> turned out of the gallery for setting all around him in a
               roar.) Think what a fine thing it would be for the members to have mirth introduced
               into the body of the house! to be sure of an honest, hearty, good-humoured laugh
               every night during the session! Besides, <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry</persName> is an admirable speaker, in every
               sense of the word. Jesting is indeed his forte, because he wills it so to be; and
               therefore, because he chooses to play jigs and country dances on a noble organ, even
               some of his stanchest admirers think he can play nothing else. There is no quality of
               which men so much grudge the reputation as versatility of talent. Because he is so
               humourous, they will hardly allow him to be eloquent; and, because he is so very
               witty, find it difficult to account him wise. But let him go where he has not that
               mischievous fame, or let him bridle his jests and rein in his humour only for one
               short hour, and he will pass for a most reverend orator,—logical, pathetic, and
               vigorous above all.—But how can I wish him to cease jesting even for an hour? Who
               would exchange the genial fame of good-humoured wit for the stern reputation of
               wisdom? Who would choose to be <persName ref="#Socrates">Socrates</persName>, if with a wish he could be <persName ref="#L_Harry_OV">Harry L.</persName>?</p>
