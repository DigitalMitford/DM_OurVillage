                <p><date when="--03-06">March 6th</date>.—Fine March weather: boisterous, blustering, much wind and squalls of rain; and yet the sky where the clouds are swept away deliciously blue, with snatches of sunshine, bright, and clear, and healthful, and the roads, in spite of the slight glittering showers, crisply dry. Altogether, the day is tempting, very tempting. It will not do for the dear common, that windmill of a walk; but the close sheltered lines at the bottom of the hill, which keep out just enough of the stormy air, and let in all the sun, will be delightful. Past <placeName ref="#Bertram_house">our old house</placeName>, and round by the winding lanes, and the <placeName ref="#parish_workhouse_OV">workhouse</placeName>, and across the lea, and so into the turnpike-road again,—that is our route for to-day. Forth we set, <persName ref="#May-flower_OV"></persName>Mayflower and <persName ref="#OVNarrator">I,</persName> rejoicing in the sunshine, and still more in the wind, which gives such an intense feeling of existence, and, co-operating with brisk motion, sets our blood and our spirits in a glow.<pb n="74"/> For mere physical pleasure, there is nothing perhaps equal to the enjoyment of being drawn, in a light carriage, against such a wind as this, by a <name type="animal" ref="#horse">blood horse</name> at his height of speed. Walking comes next to it; but walking is not quite so luxurious or so spiritual, not quite so much what one fancies of flying, or being carried above the clouds in a balloon.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, a walk is a good thing; especially under this southern hedgerow, where nature is just beginning to live again: the <name type="plant" ref="#periwinkle">periwinkles</name>, with their starry blue flowers, and their shining myrtle-like leaves, garlanding the bushes; <rs type="plant" ref="#woodbine">woodbines</rs> and <rs type="plant" ref="#elder_tree">elder-trees</rs> pushing out their small swelling buds; and grasses and mosses springing forth in every variety of brown and green. Here we are at the corner where four lanes meet, or rather where a passable road of stones and gravel crosses an impassable one of beautiful but treacherous turf, and where the small white farm-house, scarcely larger than a cottage, and the well-stocked rick-yard behind, tell of comfort and order, but leave all unguessed the great riches of <rs type="person" ref="#Barnard_farmer_OV">the master</rs>. How he became so rich is almost a puzzle; for, though the farm be his own, it is not large; and, though prudent and frugal on ordinary occasions, <persName ref="#Barnard_farmer_OV">farmer Barnard</persName> is no miser. His <name type="animal" ref="#horse #dog #pig">horses, dogs, and pigs</name>, are the best kept in the parish,—<persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May</persName> herself, although her beauty be injured by her fatness, half envies the plight of his bitch <rs type="animal" ref="#Fly_pet_OV">Fly</rs>: <rs type="person" ref="#Barnard_Mrs_OV">his wife</rs>’s gowns and<pb n="75"/> shawls cost as much again as any shawls or gowns in the village: his dinner parties (to be sure they are not frequent) display twice the ordinary quantity of good things—two couples of ducks, two dishes of green peas, two turkey poults, two gammons of bacon, two plum-puddings; moreover, he keeps a single-horse chaise, and has built and endowed a Methodist chapel. Yet is he the richest man in these parts. Every thing prospers with him. Money drifts about him like snow. He looks like a rich man. There is a sturdy squareness of face and figure; a good-humoured obstinacy; a civil importance. He never boasts of his wealth, or gives himself undue airs; but nobody can meet him at market or vestry without finding out immediately that he is the richest man there. They have no child to all this money; but there is an <rs type="person" ref="#Barnard_adopted_neph_OV">adopted nephew</rs>, a fine spirited lad, who may, perhaps, some day or other, play the part of a fountain to the reservoir.</p>
                <p>Now turn up the wide road till we come to the open common, with its park-like trees, its beautiful stream, wandering and twisting along, and its rural bridge. Here we turn again, past that other white farm-house, half hidden by the magnificent <name type="plant" ref="#elm">elms</name> which stand before it. Ah! riches dwell not there; but there is found the next best thing—an industrious and light-hearted poverty. Twenty years ago <persName ref="#White_Rachel_OV">Rachel Hilton</persName> was the prettiest and merriest lass in the country. <rs type="person" ref="#Hilton_Mr_OV">Her father</rs>, an<pb n="76"/> old game-keeper, had retired to a village ale-house, where his good beer, his social humour, and his <rs type="person" ref="#White_Rachel_OV">black-eyed daughter</rs>, brought much custom. She had lovers by the score; but <persName ref="#White_Joseph_OV">Joseph White</persName>, the dashing and lively son of an opulent farmer, carried off the <persName ref="#White_Rachel_OV">fair Rachel</persName>. They married and settled here, and here they live still, as merrily as ever, with <orgName ref="#White_children_OV">fourteen children of all ages and sizes</orgName>, from nineteen years to nineteen months, working harder than any people in the parish, and enjoying themselves more. I would match them for labour and laughter against any family in <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName>. She is a blithe, jolly dame, whose beauty has amplified into comeliness: he is tall, and thin, and bony, with sinews like whipcord, a strong lively voice, a sharp weather-beaten face, and eyes and lips that smile and brighten when he speaks into a most contagious hilarity. They are very poor, and I often wish them richer; but I don’t know—perhaps it might put them out.</p>
                <p>Quite close to <persName ref="#White_Joseph_OV">farmer White</persName>’s is a little ruinous cottage, white-washed once, and now in a sad state of betweenity, where dangling stockings and shirts swelled by the wind, drying in a neglected garden, give signal of a washerwoman. There dwells, at present in single blessedness, <persName ref="#Adams_Betty_OV">Betty Adams</persName>, the wife of <rs type="person" ref="#Adams_gardener_OV">our sometimes gardener</rs>. I never saw any one who so much reminded me in person of that lady whom every body knows, <persName ref="#Meg_Merrilies">Mistress Meg Merrilies</persName>;—as tall, as grizzled, as stately, as dark, as<pb n="77"/> gipsy-looking, bonneted and gowned like her prototype, and almost as oracular. Here the resemblance ceases. <persName ref="#Adams_Betty_OV">Mrs. Adams</persName> is a perfectly honest, industrious, pains-taking person, who earns a good deal of money by washing and charing, and spends it in other luxuries than tidiness,—in green tea, and gin, and snuff. <rs type="person" ref="#Adams_gardener_OV">Her husband</rs> lives in a great family ten miles off. He is a capital gardener—or rather he would be so, if he were not too ambitious. He undertakes all things, and finishes none. But a smooth tongue, a knowing look, and a great capacity of labour, carry him through. Let him but like his ale and his master, and he will do work enough for four. Give him his own way, and his full quantum, and nothing comes amiss to him.</p>
                <p>Ah, <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May</persName> is bounding forward! Her silly heart leaps at the sight of the old place—and so, in good truth, does mine. What a pretty place it was,—or rather, how pretty I thought it! I suppose I should have thought any place so where I had spent eighteen happy years. But it was really pretty. A large, heavy, white house, in the simplest style, surrounded by fine <name type="plant" ref="#oak">oaks</name> and <name type="plant" ref="#elm">elms</name> and tall massy plantations shaded down into a beautiful lawn, by wild overgrown shrubs, bowery <name type="plant" ref="#acacia">acacias</name>, ragged <name type="plant" ref="#sweet_briar">sweet-briars</name>, promontories of <name type="plant" ref="#dogwood">dogwood</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#Portugal_laurel">Portugal laurel</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#bay">bays</name> overhung by <name type="plant" ref="#laburnum"></name>laburnum and <name type="plant" ref="#bird_cherry">bird-cherry</name>: a long piece of water letting light into the picture, and looking just like a natural<pb n="78"/> stream, the banks as rude and wild as the shrubbery, interspersed with <name type="plant" ref="#broom">broom</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#furze">furze</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#bramble">bramble</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#oak">pollard oaks</name> covered with <name type="plant" ref="#ivy">ivy</name> and <name type="plant" ref="#honeysuckle">honeysuckle</name>; the whole enclosed by an old mossy park paling, and terminating in a series of rich meadows, richly planted. This is an exact description of the <rs type="place" ref="#Bertram_house">home</rs> which, three years ago, it nearly broke my heart to leave. What a tearing up by the root it was! I have pitied <name type="plant" ref="#cabbage">cabbage plants</name> and <name type="plant" ref="#celery">celery</name>, and all transplantable things ever since; though, in common with them and with other vegetables, the first agony of the transportation being over, I have taken such firm and tenacious hold of my new soil, that I would not for the world be pulled up again, even to be restored to the old beloved ground;—not even if its beauty were undiminished, which is by no means the case; for in those three years it has thrice changed masters, and every successive possessor has brought the curse of improvement upon the place: so that between filling up the water to cure dampness, cutting down trees to let in prospects, planting to keep them out, shutting up windows to darken the inside of the house, (by which means one end looks precisely as an eight of spades would do that should have the misfortune to lose one of his corner pips,) and building colonnades to lighten the out, added to a general clearance of pollards, and <name type="plant" ref="#bramble">brambles</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#ivy">ivy</name>, and <name type="plant" ref="#honeysuckle">honeysuckles</name>, and park palings, and irregular shrubs, the<pb n="79"/> poor place is so transmogrified, that if it had its old looking-glass, the water, back again, it would not know its own face. And yet I love to haunt round about it: so does <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May</persName>. Her particular attraction is a certain broken bank full of <name type="animal" ref="#rabbit">rabbit</name> burrows, into which she insinuates her long pliant head and neck, and tears her pretty feet by vain scratchings: mine is a warm sunny hedgerow, in the same remote field, famous for early flowers. Never was a spot more variously flowery: <name type="plant" ref="#primrose">primroses</name> yellow, <name type="plant" ref="#lilac">lilac</name>, white, <name type="plant" ref="#violet">violets</name> of either hue, <name type="plant" ref="#cowslip">cowslips</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#oxlip">oxlips</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#arum">arums</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#orchid"></name>orchises, <name type="plant" ref="#hyacinth">wild hyacinths</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#ivy">ground ivy</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#pansy">pansies</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#strawberry">strawberries</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#hearts_ease">heart’s-ease</name>, formed a small part of the Flora of that wild hedgerow. How profusely they covered the sunny open slope under the weeping <name type="plant" ref="#birch">birch</name>, <q>the lady of the woods</q><note resp="#scw">The birch tree was commonly known in folklore as <q>the lady of the woods.</q> The phrase may also derive from <persName ref="#Coleridge_ST">Coleridge</persName>'s poem <title level="a" ref="#ThePicture_STC">The Picture</title>.</note>—and how often have I started to see the early innocent <name type="animal" ref="#snake">brown snake</name>, who loved the spot as well as I did, winding along the young blossoms, or rustling amongst the fallen leaves! There are primrose leaves already, and short green buds, but no flowers; not even in that furze cradle so full of roots, where they used to blow as in a basket. No, my <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May</persName>, no <name type="animal" ref="#rabbit">rabbits</name>! no <name type="plant" ref="#primrose">primroses</name>! We may as well get over the gate into the woody winding lane, which will bring us home again.</p>
                <p>Here we are making the best of our way between the old <name type="plant" ref="#elm">elms</name> that arch so solemnly over head, dark and sheltered even now. They say that a spirit haunts this<pb n="80"/> deep pool—<rs type="person" ref="#headless_lady_OV">a white lady without a head</rs>. I cannot say that I have seen her, often as I have paced this lane at deep midnight, to hear the <name type="animal" ref="#nightingale">nightingales</name>, and look at the <name type="animal" ref="#glow_worm">glow-worms</name>;—but there, better and rarer than a thousand ghosts, dearer even than <name type="animal" ref="#nightingale">nightingales</name> or <name type="animal" ref="#glow_worm">glowworms</name>, there is a <name type="plant" ref="#primrose">primrose</name>, the first of the year; <name type="plant" ref="#primrose">a tuft of primroses</name>, springing in yonder sheltered nook, from the mossy roots of an old <name type="plant" ref="#willow">willow</name>, and living again in the clear bright pool. Oh, how beautiful they are—three fully blown and two bursting buds! how glad I am I came this way! They are not to be reached. Even <persName ref="#Rapley_Jack_OV">Jack Rapley</persName>’s love of the difficult and the unattainable would fail him here: <persName ref="#May-flower_OV">May</persName> herself could not stand on that steep bank. So much the better. Who would wish to disturb them? There they live in their innocent and fragrant beauty, sheltered from the storms, and rejoicing in the sunshine, and looking as if they could feel their happiness. Who would disturb them? Oh, how glad I am I came this way home!<pb n="81"/></p>
