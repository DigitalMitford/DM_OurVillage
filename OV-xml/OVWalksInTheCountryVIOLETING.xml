                    common that I am passing now—the lea, as
                    it is called—is one of the loveliest of these favoured spots. It is a little
                    sheltered scene, retiring, as it were, from the village; sunk amidst higher
                    lands, hills would be almost too grand a word; edged on one side by one gay high
                        road, and intersected by <pb n="102"/>another; and surrounded by a most
                    picturesque confusion of meadows, cottages, farms, and orchards; with a great
                    pond in one corner, unusually bright and clear, giving a delightful cheerfulness
                    and daylight to the picture. The <name type="animal" ref="#swallow">swallows</name>
                    haunt that pond; so do the
                        children. There is a <orgName type="person"
                        ref="#Vio_pond_children_OV">merry group</orgName> round it now; I have
                    seldom seen it without one. Children love water, clear, bright, sparkling water;
                    it excites and feeds their curiosity; it is motion and life.</p>
                <p>The path that I am treading leads to a less lively spot, to that <rs type="place"
                        ref="#parish_workhouse_OV">large heavy building</rs> on one side of the common,
                    whose solid wings, jutting out far beyond the main body, occupy three sides of a
                    square, and give a cold shadowy look to the court. On one side is a gloomy
                    garden, with an <persName ref="#Vio_old_man_OV">old man</persName> digging in
                    it, laid out in straight dark beds of
                    vegetables, <name type="plant" ref="#potato">potatoes</name>,<name type="plant"
                        ref="#cabbage">cabbages</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#onion"
                        >onions</name>, <name type="plant" ref="#bean">beans</name>; all earthy and
                    mouldy as a newly dug grave. Not a flower or a flowering shrub! Not a <name
                        type="plant" ref="#rose_tree">rose-tree</name> or a <name type="plant"
                        ref="#currant_bush">currant-bush</name>! Nothing but for sober melancholy
                    use. Oh how different from the long irregular slips of the cottage-gardens, with
                    their gay bunches of <name type="plant" ref="#polyanthus">polyanthuses</name>
                    and <name type="plant" ref="#crocus">crocuses</name>, their wallflowers, sending
                    sweet odours through the narrow casement, and their <name type="plant"
                        ref="#gooseberry_tree">gooseberry-trees</name>, bursting into a brilliancy
                    of leaf, whose vivid greenness has the effect of a blossom on the eye! Oh how
                    different! On the other side of this <rs type="place" ref="#parish_workhouse_OV"
                        >gloomy abode</rs> is a meadow of<pb n="103"/> that deep intense emerald
                    hue, which denotes the presence of stagnant water, surrounded by <name
                        type="plant" ref="#willow">willows</name> at regular distances, and, like
                    the garden, separated from the common by a wide, moat-like ditch. That is the
                        <placeName ref="#parish_workhouse_OV">parish workhouse</placeName>. All
                    about it is solid, substantial, useful;—but so dreary! so cold! so dark! There
                    are <orgName ref="#Vio_workhouse_children_OV">children</orgName> in the court and
                    yet all is silent. I always hurry past that place, as if it were a prison.
                    Restraint, sickness, age, extreme poverty, misery, which I have no power to
                    remove or alleviate,—these are the ideas, the feelings, which the sight of those
                    walls excites; yet, perhaps, if not certainly, they contain less of that extreme
                    desolation than the morbid fancy is apt to paint. There will be found order,
                    cleanliness, food, clothing, warmth, refuge for 
                        the homeless, medicine and attendance for the sick, rest and sufficiency for old age, and
                    sympathy, the true and active sympathy which the poor show to the poor, for the unhappy. There may be worse places
                    than a <placeName ref="#parish_workhouse_OV">parish workhouse</placeName>—and
                    yet I hurry past it. The feeling, the prejudice will not be
                    controlled.</p>
                <p>The end of the dreary garden edges off into a close-sheltered lane, wandering and winding, like a rivulet, in gentle <q>sinuosities,</q> (to use a word once applied by <persName ref="#Wilberforce_Wm">Mr. Wilberforce</persName> to the <placeName ref="#Henley">Thames at Henley</placeName>,<!--scw 8/8/22: Still trying to identify this quote from Wilberforce--> amidst green meadows, all alive with <name type="animal" ref="#cow">cattle</name>, <name type="animal" ref="#sheep">sheep, and beautiful lambs,</name> in the very spring and pride of their tot-<pb n="104"/>tering prettiness: or fields of arable land, more lively still with troops of stooping <orgName ref="#Vio_beansetters_OV">bean-setters</orgName>, women and children, in all varieties of costume and colour; and ploughs and harrows, with their <orgName ref="#Vio_whistling_boys_OV">whistling boys</orgName> and <orgName ref="#Vio_steady_carters_OV">steady carters</orgName>, going through, with a slow and plodding industry, the main business of this busy season. What work bean-setting is! What a reverse of the position assigned to man to distinguish him from the beasts of the field! Only think of stooping for six, eight, ten hours a day, drilling holes in the earth with a little stick, and then dropping in the beans one by one. They are paid according to the quantity they plant; and some of the poor <orgName ref="#Vio_beansetters_women_OV">women</orgName> used to be accused of clumping them—that is to say, dropping more than one bean into a hole. It seems to me, considering the temptation, that not to clump is to be at the very pinnacle of human virtue.</p>
                <p>Another turn in the lane, and we come to the <placeName ref="#Vio_old_farmhouse_OV">old house</placeName> standing amongst the high <name type="plant" ref="#elm">elms</name>—the <placeName ref="#Vio_old_farmhouse_OV">old farmhouse</placeName>, which always, I don't know why, carries back my imagination to <persName ref="#Shakespeare"><sic>Shakspeare</sic></persName>'s days. It is a long, low, irregular building, with one room, at an angle from the house, covered with <name type="plant" ref="#ivy">ivy</name>, fine white-veined ivy; the first floor of the main building projecting and supported by oaken beams, and one of the windows below, with its old casement and long narrow panes, forming the half of a shallow hexagon. A porch,<pb n="105"/> with seats in it, surmounted by a pinnacle, pointed roofs, and clustered chimneys, complete the picture. Alas! it is little else but a picture! The very walls are crumbling to decay under a <persName ref="#Vio_farmhouse_landlord_OV">careless landlord</persName> and a <persName ref="#Vio_ruined_tenant_OV">ruined tenant</persName>.</p>
                <p>Now a few yards farther, and I reach the bank. Ah! I smell them already—their exquisite perfume steams and lingers in this moist heavy air. Through this little gate, and along the green south bank of this green <name type="plant" ref="#wheat">wheat-field</name>, and they burst upon me, the lovely <name type="plant" ref="#violet">violets</name>, in tenfold loveliness! The ground is covered with them, white and purple, enamelling the short dewy grass, looking but the more vividly coloured under the dull, leaden sky. There they lie by hundreds, by thousands. In former years I have been used to watch them from the tiny green bud, till one or two stole into bloom. They never came on me before in such a sudden and luxuriant glory of simple beauty,—and I do really owe one pure and genuine pleasure to feverish <placeName ref="#London_city">London</placeName>! How beautifully they are placed too, on this sloping bank, with the palm branches waving over them, full of early <name type="animal" ref="#bee">bees</name>, and mixing their honeyed scent with the more delicate <name type="plant" ref="#violet">violet</name> odour! How transparent and smooth and lusty are the branches, full of sap and life! And there, just by the old mossy root, is a superb tuft of <name type="plant" ref="#primrose">primroses</name>, with a <name type="animal" ref="#butterfly">yellow butterfly</name> floating over them,<pb n="106"/> and looking like a flower lifted up by the air. What happiness to sit on this turfy knoll, and fill my basket with the blossoms! What a renewal of heart and mind! To sit in such a scene of peace and sweetness is again to be fearless and gay and gentle as a child. Then it is that thought becomes poetry, and feeling religion. Then it is that we are happy and good. Oh that my whole life could pass so, floating on blissful and innocent sensation, enjoying in peace and gratitude the common blessings of nature, thankful above all for the simple habits, the healthful temperament, which render them so dear! Alas! who may dare expect a life of such happiness? But I can at least snatch and prolong the fleeting pleasure, can fill my basket with <name type="plant" ref="#violet">pure flowers</name>, and my heart with pure thoughts; can gladden my little home with their sweetness; can divide my treasures with one, a <rs type="person" ref="#OVNarratorsMother">dear one</rs>!, who cannot seek them; can see them when I shut my eyes; and dream of them when I fall asleep.<pb n="107"/>

Heather, in floriography, can mean three different things. In general, it means good luck. White heather is  protection, and that wishes will come true, while lavender heather represents admiration and solitude. The latter meaning fits.</note> --></item>

Hippocrates mentioned this  plant for its medicinial properties, and the Native Americans also used willow for a staple in medical treatments. In 1763, Reverend Edward Stone in England notified the Royal Society of his findings that the willow had medicinal properties. In 1828, Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, and Raffaele Piria, an Italiam chemist, isolated the bark extract, called salicin, into a crystalline form and separated into a pure state.</note>--> </item>

                    <note resp="#qar">The elm is highly prominent in literature, with its first presence in the Iliad. It is also in the Aeneid, as the Stygian Elm. Virgil refers to a Roman superstition that elms were trees of ill-omen because their fruit seemed to have no value. Two elm-motifs have risen from classical literature: the 'Paradisal elm' motif, representing pastoral idylls, and the 'Elm and Death' motif. Many references to elm from the Renaissance onwards fit one of these two categories.
                    
The elm also holds political significance. The cutting of the elm was a diplomatic altercation between the Kings of France and England in 1188. In England, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the 'Dutch Elm' hybrid was planted and become popular with enthusiasts o the new political order. Furthermore, the 'Liberty Tree' was an American white elm in Boston. In 1775, the British felled it, and the Americans planted 'Liberty Elms' and sewed elm symbols on to their reolutionary flags.</note>-->
