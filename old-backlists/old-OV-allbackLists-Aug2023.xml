                     revolutionary France led to new alignments within his government that made his

Throughout his life, Clarkson agitated for the abolition of slavery both through the political process and as a persuasive abolitionist writer. He also founded several anti-slavery organizations. His chief practice was to travel throughout the country, gathering signatures of support for the cause, interviewing witnesses to slave trade practices, assembling evidence of its atrocities, and networking with various anti-slavery societies. Clarkson was instrumental in gathering support for the <rs type="event" ref="#AbolitionAct1807">Abolition Bill of 1807</rs>, and the <rs type="event" ref="#AbolitionSlavery1833">final Abolition Bill of 1833</rs>.

                     fame at the age of fifteen for an elegy on the death of Lord Carlton. While a

                     of his most famous works, <title>the Davideis</title>, an epic on the struggles

                     after the loss of that side. In <date when="1647">1647</date>, Cowley published

On the strength of that success, Goethe was bestowed a nobility by the young Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and appointed to administrative government posts. He was also given the management of the Weimar Theater.

                  <note resp="#scw">Charles Perrault is today best known as the inventor of the
                     modern fairy tale. Born into a wealthy family, Perrault spent his career as a
                     secretary in the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. He also worked in
                     various capacities within the court of Louis XIV to promote the King's
                     projects. He was a prominent advocate for the Modern side in the debate between
                     the Ancients and the Moderns in excellence in the arts, and a distinguished art
                     critic. In <date when="1671">1671</date>, he was elected to the
                        <foreign>Academie francaise</foreign>. After he was forcibly retired from
                     the court by one of his rivals and denied his government pension, he turned to
                     writing. He published an epic poem, then, in <date when="1697">1697</date>
                     composed a collection of fairy tales under the name of his youngest son, Pierre
                     Darmancourt, entitled <title level="m">Tales and Stories of the Past with
                        Morals</title>. This collection of stories, drawn from previous literary
                     collections and from French folk tales, featured tales that became classics,
                     such as <title level="a">Little Red Riding Hood</title>, <title level="a"
                        >Cinderella; or the Little Glass Slipper</title>, <title level="a"
                        >Bluebeard</title>, and <title level="a">Sleeping Beauty</title>. The volume went through numerous
                     editions, translations, and adaptations. By Mitford's time, Perrault's tales
                     were recognized and published as stories for children, despite their sometimes
                     racy themes.</note>

                  <note resp="#scw">Christopher Smart was a prolific writer and translator of religious,

                     plays, but also to accumulate debts that would follow him for the rest of his
                     life. He began contributing to the magazine <title level="m">The

                  <note resp="#qar">The elm is highly prominent in literature, with its first
                     presence in the Iliad. It is also in the Aeneid, as the Stygian Elm. Virgil
                     refers to a Roman superstition that elms were trees of ill-omen because their
                     fruit seemed to have no value. Two elm-motifs have risen from classical
                     literature: the <q>Paradisal elm</q> motif, representing pastoral idylls, and the
                     <q>Elm and Death</q> motif. Many references to elm from the Renaissance onwards fit
                     one of these two categories. The elm also holds political significance. The
                     cutting of the elm was a diplomatic altercation between the Kings of France and
                     England in 1188. In England, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the 'Dutch
                     Elm' hybrid was planted and become popular with enthusiasts o the new political
                     order. Furthermore, the 'Liberty Tree' was an American white elm in Boston. In
                     1775, the British felled it, and the Americans planted 'Liberty Elms' and sewed
                     elm symbols on to their reolutionary flags.</note>

                  <note resp="#scw">Thomson's final poem, published just before he died. The two-canto work, which is written in Spenserian stanzas, satirically pits a languid world ruled over by an archimage named Indolence against a space where the Knights of Arts and Industry bring activity and progress to England. The poem was widely excerpted and quoted by later poets and novelists.</note>

                     of which were composed for the book itself, White describes his observations of
                     local natural surroundings, flora, fauna, and geologic formation in minute
                     detail. These observations were carefully prepared from notes White took over
                     time, and were meant to be a scientific record of the natural phenomena under
                     discussion, coupled with an assessment of the social conditions of the area.
                     The book was immensely successful, and is considered an early example of
                     ecological exploration. It was a favorite book of <persName ref="#MRM"
